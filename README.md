# Hangman-Project
This project is a Hangman Game implemented in Python. Players attempt to guess a randomly chosen word by guessing letters one at a time. The game provides visual feedback on the player's progress and tracks lives lost for incorrect guesses. It uses modular components like word lists and ASCII art to enhance gameplay.
